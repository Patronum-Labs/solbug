## Security Considerations

While caching the owner and ensuring it hasn't changed after the delegate call provides a basic level of security, this approach may not be sufficient in all scenarios as it gives a false sense of security.

An attacker could still exploit the contract during the delegate call by changing the owner, performing malicious actions, and then restoring the original owner before the check.
